# Using Kafka in the Users App

The Users App is the producer and the My Retro App is the consumer.

## NOTES

You need to make sure your Kafka service is up and running.

You can run it using the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root of this project.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now you can run the My Retro app, then the Users App.

```bash


## Stop Kafka

```bash
docker compose down
```
